Analyze users log data in using a mobile app.

The log data is the session created time by each user.

The analysis here is to spot patterns in sessions to understand user behavior in using this mobile app.

Further, a new feature (hypothetically) is implemented and we would want to see how user react to this new feature.

Analytical methods used here: chi square test, z test in comparing two proportions, boostraping, two sample t test

Data manipulation: Aggregation, Sessionization

Others: Data mining pipeline, and documentation
